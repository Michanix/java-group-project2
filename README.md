<h2>Second group project for Java course in college</h2>
<p>This is small text-based rpg game inspired by DnD(sort of). It was build with GUI JavaFx library.</p>
<p>Here is implemented basic I/O operation which let you save the players, fight some monster, find some artifacts
and maybe even learn something new.</p>
<p>When the game first launched it will create 'local database' which in this case a txt file name 'players.txt'.
Later all information about player is extracted from there.</p>

<p>Game supposed to base on a "pure luck", but since you have full access to
the source code you are free to create your own definition of "pure luck".
Also, you can add your own kind of monsters, if you wish
(You also would have to alter game logic a bit, but nothing is perfect, am I right?).</p>


<p>You are free to use code from this project as an example to start with JavaFX or
if you need some ready to work snippets feel free to grab them.</p>
